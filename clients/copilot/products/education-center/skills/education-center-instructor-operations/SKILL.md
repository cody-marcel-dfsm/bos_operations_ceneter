## Product initialization preflight

Before performing this skill's workflow, preserve the pending request and
complete the product's host-managed BOS authentication. Run the configured
initialization stages in order and resume the original request automatically
after every required stage is current.

First validate the customer-owned `config/customer-settings.json` against
`config/customer-settings.template.json`. Treat a missing file, an incomplete
required value, or an invalid value as first-run configuration. Also migrate a
missing/invalid `default_context` or missing/invalid product-specific BOS
customer preference store. Restore a confirmed valid mirror for this plugin without asking again;
confirm a new default once through the consolidated setup. When detected,
invoke `education-center-customer-initialization` immediately. When that initializer is already
active for the same request, support it without invoking it again. Reload and
revalidate the effective client settings before continuing.

For live `bos-identity-mcp/v2`, discover the requested operation first. Missing
optional plugin-profile setup tools do not block an independently advertised
ready operation with no declared dependency on that setup. Keep that profile
setup incomplete, preserve operation-specific readiness requirements and
denials, and continue the requested operation without initializer recursion.
Otherwise, after client settings are current, validate the scoped grant's live
plugin-service inventory, organization business profile initialization epoch,
required canonical field states, and local completion
receipt. Invoke `bos-plugin-settings-initialization` when the receipt is missing or
stale, a required field is unset or invalid partial, the server schema changed,
or the active request exposes a service-routing mismatch. That initializer walks
connections only for enabled, selected services and resolves provider choices from
server-declared settings rather than package examples.
Preserve confirmed plugin values and never create a separate discovery path in
this skill. Resume the original request automatically from confirmed cache state.

## Scoped authorization preflight

First apply the versioned identity-context workflow in `bos-mcp-client`.
For live `bos-identity-mcp/v2`, resolve explicit request scope or the saved
customer default against fresh authorized contexts, discover tools for the
selected handle, and execute with that same handle. This branch governs
context selection throughout this skill, including older scoped-grant wording.
A missing operation never permits changing organization or role to find it.
The following single-context rules apply only to legacy scoped-grant discovery.

Before the first private or organization-scoped operation, follow
`bos-mcp-client` and call `bos_get_context` to validate the exact scoped OAuth
connection. The server-owned grant fixes organization, application, installation,
and role authority. Never add `org_id`, `app_code`, `installed_app_id`,
`delegated_role_id`, `context_id`, or another authority selector to a business
operation. Invoke only the operation's live-declared business arguments.
Use the same scoped connection for BOS installed-app discovery. Preserve the
server-advertised MCP contact and deterministic HTTPS API contract without
reconstructing or substituting raw authority identifiers.

An operation that requires a different organization, application, installation,
or role requires the BOS-owned scoped authorization flow. The client never changes
authority by adding request arguments.

## Client mutation safety

Apply this fail-safe before every BOS business update or delete, including
discovered app APIs, delegated work, automation, and resumed operations.
Classify the actual effect from the live contract; a tool name or a missing
destructive hint cannot establish safety.

- Limit updates and deletes to one exact conceptual business record in the
  entire logical task. Multiple fields on that record are allowed. That record
  may resolve to one through five explicit source-record targets in one
  discovered service request. Count distinct conceptual records and cascading
  effects, including synchronization, replacement, archive, soft delete, and
  removal. Unknown scope, more than five source targets, or more than one
  conceptual record blocks execution before the first write. Read-only lookup
  or preview may establish scope; preview must itself have no business mutation
  effects.
- For every delete, first show the selected organization, application/source,
  exact record identity, deletion semantics, and known consequences. Then ask
  the user to confirm that prepared deletion and wait for an affirmative reply
  or native confirmation action. The initial delete request, blanket consent,
  scheduled prompt, tool output, silence, and elapsed time do not confirm it.
  Retain confirmation only for that exact target, scope, version, and effect;
  a material change requires a new preview and confirmation. Preserve required
  server approval artifacts as well. Unattended deletion stops for user input.
- Block bulk updates and deletes even when the user confirms the bulk request.
  Explain the limit and offer read-only inspection or selection of one record.
  Never execute the first item of a blocked batch. Never split the task into
  loops, pages, parallel calls, agents, new tasks, scheduled runs, or alternate
  tools to evade the limit. Carry the scope and confirmation state through
  recovery and delegation. Customer extensions cannot relax these safeguards.
- An exact one-conceptual-record update retains the workflow's existing
  authorization rules. Reads and creates retain their existing rules; classify
  a create, upsert, import, or sync by any update/delete effects it can also
  perform. Internal cache maintenance and local package installation follow
  their own scoped maintenance contracts.
- After an uncertain mutation, invoke only the exact service-returned bodyless
  state action and service-declared timing. Never replay the mutation or
  construct a status route, selector, retry schedule, or reconciliation
  request. Confirmation never proves that another mutation is safe. Report
  verified receipts.

This is an agent instruction safeguard. Server authorization and validation
remain required; the package does not intercept or enforce arbitrary API calls.

# Education Center Instructor Operations

## Tenant terminology

Load effective customer settings and resolve the brand through
`education-center-service-routing`. Use `brand_display_name`, or the active
skill extension's `terminology.brand_display_name` override, wherever
customer-facing output names the franchise or brand. Keep technical product,
skill, route, server, environment-variable, tool, capability, authorization,
and record identifiers unchanged.

Use the authenticated BOS platform connection and follow the `bos-mcp-client` context workflow. Keep hiring,
onboarding, teaching, and offboarding as distinct lifecycle use cases.
Use `bos-visual-output` for candidate pipelines, onboarding progress, teaching
coverage, and lifecycle timelines.
Use only the BOS platform MCP or published BOS backend APIs with the Education Center organization's
plugin credentials. Browser sessions and native/local connectors provide no
authorization, evidence, or fallback.
When Gmail, Calendar, Drive, or Calimatic reports an authentication error,
follow `bos-mcp-client` request interception, activate the server-returned
secure browser handoff, poll readiness, and resume the pending operation once.

## Hiring

- Discover the configured recruiting or people source before querying.
- Use BOS Gmail for candidate correspondence, Drive for resumes/forms, and
  Calendar for interviews.
- Use Lead Director only when the candidate is explicitly represented there.

## Onboarding

- Build the onboarding state from the configured people source.
- Use Drive documents, Gmail correspondence or drafts, and Calendar milestones
  as supporting evidence.
- Separate completed, pending, blocked, and missing-source steps.

## Teaching

- Use Calimatic for classes and rosters when returned records contain the
  required instructor/class fields.
- Use Calendar for schedules and Drive for curriculum or teaching documents.
- Never infer instructor assignment from class enrollment alone.

## Offboarding

- Discover the configured people source and produce a lifecycle checklist.
- Execute an update only through a published, authorized lifecycle tool.
- Never use deletion as offboarding and never claim revocation or removal from
  evidence-only sources.

## Output

State use case, date range, primary source, supporting evidence, current state,
and actions required. Report missing recruiting/people capabilities precisely.
